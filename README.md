## üåê Live Demo
**[View Live Site](https://moviecriticfi.onrender.com)** ‚≠ê Try it out without any setup!

> **Note:** The live site automatically logs you in as a demo user for instant access. This demo mode prevents database tampering, so some features are view-only (adding members, updating profiles, changing passwords, adding/deleting movies and reviews are disabled). You can still browse the full movie collection, explore detailed movie pages, and read community reviews.
